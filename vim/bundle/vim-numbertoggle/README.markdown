# numbertoggle

While Vim's relativenumber option is great, you probably don't want to use it all the time. numbertoggle allows you to quickly toggle between relative and absolute line numbers and cleverly switches when when focus is lost or gained or when switching between normal and insert mode.

## Installation

If you don't have a preferred installation method, I recommend installing [pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen), and then simply copy and paste:

    cd ~/.vim/bundle
    git clone git://github.com/jeffkreeftmeijer/vim-numbertoggle.git

Once help tags have been generated, you can view the manual with
`:help numbertoggle`.
